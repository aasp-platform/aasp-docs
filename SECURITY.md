## Security Features

AASP is built with security in mind:

- **API Key Hashing**: Keys are stored as SHA-256 hashes, not plaintext
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All API communication is encrypted
- **Session Security**: httpOnly cookies with secure flags
- **Audit Logging**: All actions are logged for compliance
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse (coming soon)

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS endpoints
4. **Least Privilege**: Use test keys (`aasp_test_*`) during development
5. **Key Rotation**: Rotate API keys regularly

Thank you for helping keep AASP and its users safe!
